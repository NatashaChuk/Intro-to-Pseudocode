Exercises
For exercises requiring code, you are free to use the language of your choice.


What is a binary tree and what makes it unique to other trees?
A: A data structure that has a root and may have up to two child Nodes, which makes it unique to other 
   trees.

What is a heuristic?
A: A heuristic is an educated guess sufficient for reaching an immediate goal.

What is another problem besides the shortest-path problem that requires the use of heuristics?
A: Online searches. To find the most revelant resources you would use heuristics to guess what words or 
   phrases would best work.

What is the difference between a depth-first search and a breadth-first search?
A: A DFS searches down a single branch to find the desired element, then moves upward and down again,
   if the element is not found. BFS searches across rows of Nodes before traveling down to the next 
   branch/row. 

Explain in your own words what an undirected, a-cyclic, unweighted graph is.
A: A graph that connects two Nodes but does not have a beginning or an end, does not form loops, and
   does not assign the cost of travel between Nodes.

What kind of graph is a binary search tree?
A: An undirected, a-cyclic, unweighted graph.


Programming Questions

1. Given a Binary Search Tree and a value, write a function that checks to see whether the value exists within the tree.

   Example: The value 10 exists in the tree. The value 23 does not exist in the tree.

var tree = {
  value: 8,
  left: {
    value: 3,
    left: {
      value: 1,
      right: null,
      left: null,
    },
    right: {
      value: 6,
      right: {
        value: 7,
        right: null,
        left: null,
      },
      left: {
        value: 4,
        right: null,
        left: null,
      }
    }
  },
  right: {
    value: 10,
    left: null,
    right: {
      value: 14,
      right: null,
      left: {
        value: 13,
        right: null,
        left: null,
      }
    }
  }
}


   function searchTree(value) {
     let current = tree;

      while(current) {
         if(current.value == value) {
            return true;
         } else if (current.value > value) {
	      current = current.left;
         } else {
              current = current.right;
         }
       }	
	return false;	          
      }

   

         function findRoute(value) {
      	   var current = tree;
	   var array = ['tree'];
	   while(current) {
		if(current.value == value) {
		   array.push('value');
		   return array;
		} else if (current.value > value ) {
		   array.push('left');
		   current = current.left;
		} else {
	           array.push('right');
		   current = current.right;
		}
	    }
	    return false;
          }

	     function getDistance(n1, n2) {
	       var n1 = findRoute(n1);
	       var n2 = findRoute(n2);   
             
	       for (let i = 0; i < n1.length; i++) {
	        if(n1[i] !== n2[i]) {
              	   var distance = ((n1.length - i) + (n2.length - i) - 2);
		   return distance; 
              }
            }

          }   
	
         console.log(searchTree(5));
         console.log(searchTree(10));
  
	 console.log(getDistance(1, 10));
	 console.log(getDistance(4, 14));
	 console.log(getDistance(3, 7));
